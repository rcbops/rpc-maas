Utilizes a custom plugin, ``cinder_service_check.py``, which runs locally to
generate metrics from each ``cinder_backup`` node. Metrics generated by this check
determine the active status of cinder backup on each node.

.. note::

    This check is only deployed if Cinder backups are enabled using
    variable ``cinder_service_backup_program_enabled`` (non-default).
