Utilizes a custom plugin, ``vg_check.py``, which runs locally to generate
metrics from each ``cinder_volume`` node. This check is deployed if Cinder
volumes are backed by LVM. Metrics generated by this check provide context of
usage percentages across all Cinder nodes.

.. note::

    There are no active alarms associated with this check. Metrics returned
    by the plugin are informative in nature.

An example of properly executing the ``cinder_vg_check`` plugin:

.. code-block:: console

    root@cinder1:~# /usr/lib/rackspace-monitoring-agent/plugins/run_plugin_in_venv.sh \
      /usr/lib/rackspace-monitoring-agent/plugins/vg_check.py \
      cinder-volumes
    status okay
    metric cinder-volumes_vg_total_space int64 9569495 Megabytes
    metric cinder-volumes_vg_free_space int64 3342 Megabytes
    metric cinder-volumes_vg_used_space int64 9566153 Megabytes
