# maas_fqdn_extension: Sets the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) extension that will be appended
#                      to the short names for hosts that are specified in rpc_user_config. This
#                      avoids the need to specify extremely long container names.
#
#   For example, if this variable was not set, a device called 12345-node1.mytestcluster.com would
#   have to be named in openstack_user_config.yml as 12345-node1.mytestcluster.com for MaaS checks
#   to be created correctly. However, if maas_fqdn_extension is set as .mytestcluster.com, the
#   device can be named 12345-node1 in openstack_user_config.yml. This enables shorter container
#   names while still enabling MaaS checks and alarms to be created properly.

# maas_monitoring_zones: Specifies the list of data centers (DCs) to poll from for remote
#                        (non-agent) checks.

# The default is usually sufficient; for example, if three out of five zones return without failure,

# does not include the blocked DC.
