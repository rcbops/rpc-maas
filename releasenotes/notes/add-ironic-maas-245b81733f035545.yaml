    Add support for the RPC ironic deployment, which enables the
    monitoring of the RPC ironic service. This introduces a private version of the
    set of API checks that make against the OpenStack Ironic, including:
    ironic capacity check:  the percentage of ironic up nodes to total nodes count
    ironic conductor check: ensure ironic conductor is running
    ironic compute check:   make sure nova compute service is available
    
    You can define threshold for ironic capacity check, from 
    ``maas_capacity_percent_warning_threshold`` variable, which defaults to 20.0, and
    ``maas_capacity_percent_critical_threshold`` variable, which defaults to 10.0
