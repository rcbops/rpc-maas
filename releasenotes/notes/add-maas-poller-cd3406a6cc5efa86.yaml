    Add support for the rackspace-monitoring-poller, which enables the
    monitoring of private networks. This introduces a private version of the
    set of API checks that are made against each of the OpenStack services,
    all with the prefix ``private_lb_api_check``.

    In order to have the poller installed and setup, the
    ``maas_private_monitoring_enabled`` variable needs to be set to ``True``,
    and a value for ``maas_private_monitoring_zone`` must be set.
