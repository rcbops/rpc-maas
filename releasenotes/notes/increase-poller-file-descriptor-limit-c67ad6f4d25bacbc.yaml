    Set the file descriptor limit for rackspace-monitoring-poller to 16384.
    This change ensures that regardless of which platform the poller is
    running on, the file descriptor limit will be set to 16384.

    Additionally, this change adds a check on rackspace-monitoring-poller's
    file descriptor usage, prefixed with ``maas_poller_fd_count``, which
    creates a warning alert at 80% capacity and a critical alert at 90%
    capacity of the 16384 limit.
