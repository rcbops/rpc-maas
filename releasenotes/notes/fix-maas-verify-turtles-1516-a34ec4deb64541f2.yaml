fixes:
  - Fix rpc-maas-tool.py to report excludedchecks as the check will always be created
  - Gating: Enable 'maas_verify_registration' in gating to validate alarms are created in the api
  - Gating: Enable 'maas_verify_status' in gating to validate alarms are not critical after deployments
  - Gating: Tweak existing variable overrides for different gating release versions. Remove alarm
    exclusions, frequency changes, and update excluded checks to include 'horizon_local_check'
    in newton and onward.
